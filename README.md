# GPTBox

This is a Python script which generates coreutils programs on the fly. Think of it as `busybox` but generated with AI.

### Why?
AI is everywhere now. Why not replace your coreutils with it? 

### How?
The program uses the ollama Python API to generate a Python script that implements a command. It then writes it to a file and executes it.
